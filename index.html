        <strong>Rock music</strong> is a broad genre of popular music that originated as <em>"rock and roll"</em> in the United States in the late 1940s
        and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles in the mid-1960s and later, particularly in the United
        States and the United Kingdom. It has its roots in 1940s and 1950s rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the
        blues and rhythm and blues genres of African-American music and from country music.
